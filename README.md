Salmon Cookies
I built an app that populates a random number of customers per hours and then populates an unordered list per city of how many cookies are needed to be baked at each location to meet the demand.  I have also included the total number of cookies for each store.

Reflections and Comments:
I learned that the code and project structure that I was setting up was pure crap.  I now understand the importance of a render method location with the objects to clean up the code.  This makes the code SOOOO much more readable.  I also learned how properly set up folders for files and how to use ../ in order to link those pages.  Thank you again for not lettig me slide on this project, because having to go through and fix/update everything has taught me a lot and makes me feel much more confortable with being able to read and understand my code.  There was just way too much on the page before.
