Salmon Cookies
I built an app that populates a random number of customers per hours and then populates an unordered list per city of how many cookies are needed to be baked at each location to meet the demand.  I have also included the total number of cookies for each store. In addition we've styled the table that contains the data and also the index.html page.  Now Pat's cookies have a nice website to view and look at the different products that Pat's Cookies offers.

Reflections and Comments:
I learned how to access the elements using css selectors rather than relying purely on classes and ids.  I feel much more confident with experimenting and looking up different CSS selectors.  I would like to get more practice at this to reduce redundancy in my CSS and write more elegant code.
